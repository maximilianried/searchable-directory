# Searchable web directory

## Description
I created this application to easily search for all the important websites at my university without having to bookmark every single page. <br>
The application features a settings menu with options for...

* Setting dark or light mode
* Creating a new when a card is clicked
* Quick search automatically selects the input field

When a card is clicked the app will redirect to the desired page.
Depending on the settings the page will be load in the same tab or in a new tab.

## Technologies
This Project uses the ReactJS Framework and Bootstrap for the CSS. <br>
Boostrap-Icons are used for the cards and the settings menu. <br>
Using the app will create locally stored variables to save the settings.
